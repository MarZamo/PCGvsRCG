Wake up...


At last...
My thoughts have\nreached you, son.
They are the only things\nwhich I am allowed to keep...
So listen to them...
... and grant me revenge.


Collect every gate component\nto unlock jumpgates.
The icons on a door indicate\nhow many keys are needed.


There is a solid ring with a\npointer surrounding your armor...
This compass will lead\nyou to the truth...
The arrow on the ring surrounding\nyou points to the next target.


Shoot at buttons to activate\ndevices or open doors.


Don't be afraid of entering the portal.
Such gates will let you travel\nto different nodes in time and space.


A node can be entered only with its\ndefault armor until it is cleared\nfor the first time.
Once a node is cleared,\nit can be entered with\ndifferent armors.
New armor available at Kyllene.\nCollect a mask to summon an armor.
You must defeat each of those\ntraitors with every armor to\nlight the Kyllene Wheel\nat full power.


Tap the boost key to multiply\nthe active thrusters power
Advanced Boost does not work by tapping\nthe boost key, but holding it.


Heavy impacts at great speeds may destroy\nyour armor, even if you have shields left.


Look, son...
This is the key to\nruling time and space...
Take it and\nopen the gates...
... to our fate.


Even if you don't remember who you are...
I know well what I owe you, son.
Accept your reward...
... and let all knowledge become one.


Yes, four gods...
They are the ones to\nblame for all.
Vermis, the first of them\nbut not the oldest...
The worm god will rise when\nthe disturbance reaches the\npillared shrine.


We are closer to freedom...
They will pay for their crime.\nRepentance will not erase the guilt.
Far beyond the metal forest, Teuthus sleeps peacefully...
Don't be reckless, he has always\nknown that we would search for him.


Time and space are on our side...
There is no way they\ncan warn each other.
Every device ruled by Argos works\nto gather raw energy for their master...
A greed which is second only\nto his brute force.


There is only one way to\nfuse these branches and reign:
bring the same fate\nto all of them.
Orion chose a world filled\nwith life and taught its offspring.
The hunter and his tribe will use\ntheir science to destroy you at any cost.


The big one is a menace...
Take its life...


Vermis is an elderly god...
But not totally weak...


His strength goes beyond his arms...
Don't hesitate...


Argos has the upper\nhand in close combat...
It is time to test your agility...


Orion knows the principles\nbehind your armors...
Show him what you have learnt.


...
There is a long way to go...
Now sleep, son...


Thank you, son.
Those remaining realities\nin which I was defeated...
... now they are just bad dreams.
...
These brothers did well,\nmy soul was nearly sealed.
But I was still able to reach\nto the strongest of them...
... and erase his mind. Your mind.


My gift to you...
I will take you to the same place...
... where your memories rest.


Don't you understand?
If I return to Chaos,\nthe world we have built\nwill be lost only to start again...
I just wanted to bring this\nendless circle to a close.
But I guess you can't\nescape your nature...
... and your nature is to survive.


It is time to\nmake your choice.
End your existence here in the void...
or enter the gate and give back\nthe time I granted you.


Wake up, son...
Let's play this hopeless\ngame one more time.
