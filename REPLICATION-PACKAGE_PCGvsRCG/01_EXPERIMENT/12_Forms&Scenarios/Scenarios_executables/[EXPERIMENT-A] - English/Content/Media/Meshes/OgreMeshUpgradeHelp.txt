Provided for OGRE by Steve Streeting 2004-2012

Usage: OgreMeshUpgrader [opts] sourcefile [destfile] 
-i             = Interactive mode, prompt for options
-l lodlevels   = number of LOD levels
-d loddist     = distance increment to reduce LOD
-p lodpercent  = Percentage triangle reduction amount per LOD
-f lodnumtris  = Fixed vertex reduction per LOD
-e         = DON'T generate edge lists (for stencil shadows)
-t         = Generate tangents (for normal mapping)
-td [uvw|tangent]
           = Tangent vertex semantic destination (default tangent)
-ts [3|4]      = Tangent size (3 or 4 components, 4 includes parity, default 3)
-tm            = Split tangent vertices at UV mirror points
-tr            = Split tangent vertices where basis is rotated > 90 degrees
-r         = DON'T reorganise buffers to recommended format
-d3d       = Convert to D3D colour formats
-gl        = Convert to GL colour formats
-srcd3d    = Interpret ambiguous colours as D3D style
-srcgl     = Interpret ambiguous colours as GL style
-E endian  = Set endian mode 'big' 'little' or 'native' (default)
-b         = Recalculate bounding box (static meshes only)
-V version = Specify OGRE version format to write instead of latest
             Options are: 1.8, 1.7, 1.4, 1.0
sourcefile = name of file to convert
destfile   = optional name of file to write to. If you don't
             specify this OGRE overwrites the existing file.
